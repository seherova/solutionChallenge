# Solution Challenge

##  Support App
The earthquake that hit the Turkiye on February 6, 2023 made all of us deeply upset. Even we are psychologically affected so much. We empathized with other students that affected by earthquake. So we decided to develop an app to help them.

We aim to reduce inequalities arising from unusual situations like this disaster. Our app provides access to psychological support by volunteer psychologists, educational support by volunteer teachers and other students. There is a section that people can share their books to other students in need. Also, there is a donation field to support students. We want to make the process easier for students that are affected by disasters.
